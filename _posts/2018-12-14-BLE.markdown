# Classic Bluetooth && BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)
   **Bluetooth** is long range networking protocol (like WI-FI) which is designed to quickly and automatically connect devices. 

## Basic
1. What is **Classic Bluetooth**?
   - It is designed for continuous two-way data transfer. 
   - It is highly effective, but only for short distances.
   - It is a perfect solution in the case of streaming audio and video, or mice and other devices that need a continuous, broadband link.
   
2. What is **BLE 4.0**? 
   - Bluetooth Low Energy is developed by the [Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG)](https://www.bluetooth.com/) for **short-range communication**. 
   - BLE is not intended to use for stream data 
   - **Low power consumption** is the most important difference (Most important difference)

3. **Commons** between Classic Bluetooth and BLE 
    - Both Classic Bluetooth and BLE operate in the same 2.4 GHz ISM band.
    - Both Classic Bluetooth and BLE operate with the same pairing technology, **authentication** and even **encryption**
    - Both Classic Bluetooth and BLE operate in **Classic master-slave model**. Which means first the bluetooth devices need to be paired and then the data transmission can happen.     

4. **Difference** between Classic Bluetooth and BLE 
    - BLE 4.0 offers low power consumption of magnitude of 1-50% of that of Classic Bluetooth.
    - **Classic Bluetooth** can handle a lot of data, but consumes battery life quickly and costs a lot more. 
    - **BLE** is used for applications that do not need to exchange large amounts of data, and can therefore run on battery power for years at a cheaper cost.

5. What is **Service**? 
    - Collections of characteristics and relationships to other services that encapsulate the behavior of part of a device.
    
6. What is **Characteristic**? 
    - Characteristic(attribute types) can be considered as a variable. Which contains a single locial value. 

7. What is **GATT**? 
    - GATT(Generic Attribute Profile) is two BLE devices transfer data back and forth using concepts called Service and Characteristics. 
    - GATT database is comprised of Services and Characteristics. 
    - All functions are divided up into services and characteristics. 
    - Each service and characteristic has its own **UUID**
    
8. What is **GAP**? 
    - GAP(Generic Attribute Profile) controls **connections** and **advertising** Bluetooth. 
    - GAP is what makes your device visible to the outside world, and determines how two devices can(or can't) interact with each other. 
   
9. Two key concepts for **Device Roles**
    - **Central devices** 
        + Central device is usually mobile phone or tablet that you connect to with far more processing power and memory. 
    - **Peripheral devices** 
        + Peripheral device is small, low power, resource contrained devices which can connect to a much more powerful central device
        + Such as, heart rate monitor, a BLE enabled proximity tag(근접센서 태그), etc.
    
10. Two models BLE uses are.
    - **Advertising mode** (= Broadcast Mode)
        + Peripheral sends out a bit of information(advertising interval) that any device in the area can pick up. So that central devices know that there are peripherals around 
       
    - **Connected mode**
        + Peripheral and central device establish a one-to-one conversation. This is how they exchange complex information.

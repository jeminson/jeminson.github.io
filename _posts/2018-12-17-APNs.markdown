# APNs (Apple Push Notification Service) 
  - **APNs** platform notification service created by Apple Inc. that enables third party application developers to send notification data to applications installed on Apple devices 
  
## APNs Workflow 
![APNs Workflow](/assets/images/APNsWorkFlow.png)

### Workflow (Mechanism)
1. The app register push notifications for the iOS 
2. iOS asks for **device token** from **APNs Server**
3. Once the app receives the **device token**, the app will send the token to **external server**
4. When something interesting happens, the server sends **push notification** to the **APNs server**
5. Then the **APNs** sends the push notification to the app

### APNs Payload 
 - Each notification your provider server sends to the Apple Push Notification service (APNs) includes a payload. 
 - Payload contains any custom data that you want to send to your app and includes information about how the system should notify the user. 
 - You construct this payload as a JSON dictionary and send it as the body content of your HTTP/2 message. 
 - The maximum size of the payload depends on the notification you are sending:
    + For **TCB Binary API** - Maximum size is 2KB
    + For **regular remote notifications** - Maximum size is 4KB (4096 bytes)
    + For **Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) notifications** = Maximum size is 5KB (5120 bytes)

# MVC (Model-View-Controller) 
  - **Model** is where your data resides 
  - **View** is the face of the app (reusable)
    + UILabel is a **view** that presents text on the screen
  - **Controller** mediates between the view and the model, typically via the delegation pattern 
    + Controller entity won't know the concrete view it's dealing with. Instead, it will communicate with an abstraction via a protocol. 
    + **Example** can be ```UITableView``` communicate with its data source via the ```UITableViewDataSource``` protocol

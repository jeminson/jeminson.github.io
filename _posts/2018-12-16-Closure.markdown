# Closure 
  - **Closure** can capture and store references to any constants and variables from the context in which they are defined.
  
  
## The Sorted Method 
  - Swift's standard library provides a method called **sorted(by:)**, which sorts an array of values of a known type.
  
## Syntax 
```
  { (parameters) -> return type in 
      statements
  }
```
